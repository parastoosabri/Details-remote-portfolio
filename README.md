# 📂 Welcome to My Demo Portfolio

If you're here, you've likely seen my resume — welcome!

This GitHub profile contains **simple, fictional demos** that represent tools and workflows I've used professionally. These aren't real client projects — they’re **imaginary but realistic examples** to show how I work with platforms like Slack, Salesforce, Notion, NetSuite, and others.

## What’s inside each folder
Each project folder (e.g., `Slack`, `Google Sheets`, `Salesforce`) contains:
- A sample or mockup file
- A `README.md` explaining the use case
- Screenshots or embedded links if available

## Why I created this
- To show hands-on knowledge of real platforms
- To simulate task coordination across departments
- To demonstrate my ability to think in systems

## Notes
- The data is fictional.
- The demos are simple but thoughtfully structured.
- They’re created only to highlight familiarity, not real-world complexity.

Thanks for visiting✨.

I hope this gives you a good idea of how I work👩🏻‍💻.
